Two X-2 airframes ... built ... using stainless steel and K-monel
https://www.nasa.gov/aeronautics/bell-x-2/


The X-2's aft fuselage, wings, and tail unit were made from stainless steel

the wing carry-though structure and the rest of the fuselage were made from K-Monel, 
a difficult to work alloy of nickel and copper, twice as strong as stainless steel (but heavier), with high thermal conductivity.

X-2's cockpit was insulated by glass fibre
