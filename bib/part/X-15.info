Airframe
“hot structure” design with no external insulation (other than around the cockpit)
All of the airplane’s skin would be Inconel X, and most of the internal wing and fuselage load carrying structures would be of titanium except for high heat areas that would be Inconel X.
Internal structures not subject to high heats and high loads would be aluminum.


Cockpit
The cockpit would be a sealed aluminum structure within the Inconel X skin, and it would have a layer of insulation
